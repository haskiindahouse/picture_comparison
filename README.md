## How to use
Firstly, clone the repo<br>
You can use cmake as you wish(ccmake, cmake gui etc) or just run `cmake`<br>
After this you can just:`clang main.cpp`<br>
## IMPORTANT
You need to install `OpenCV` on your device.<br>
On MacOs you can easily install lib with `homebrew`.
`cv::imread` work properly with absolute path to .png files.<br>
I tested on MacOs with `CLion IDE` :smile:
